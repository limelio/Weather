Create a Java solution to the problem of computing the daily average
temperature for a given month. Your solution will have the daily high 
and low
temperature for each day of the month initialized into arrays. Calculate 
and
store the daily average temperature in a third array. You will also 
calculate the
monthly average temperature and how many days were above that average.
Display your results in a professional looking report. Here is
some sample data:
